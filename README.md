## Todo List App - Django REST API (DRF)
### Description

This is a Django REST Framework (DRF) project for managing todo items. The API allows users to register, log in, create, update, delete todos, and retrieve todo details.

The project is Dockerized for easy deployment and development environment setup.

## Features

- **User Authentication (Dockerized):** Users can register, login, and logout. JWT authentication is used to secure the API endpoints.
- **Todo Management (Dockerized):** Users can create, retrieve, update, and delete todos. Todos have attributes such as title, description, due date, priority, and completion status.
- **Pagination and Filtering (Dockerized):** Todos are paginated to improve performance, and filtering options are available based on various attributes such as title, completion status, priority, and due date.
- **Swagger Documentation (Dockerized):** API documentation is generated using Swagger, providing an interactive interface for exploring the endpoints.
